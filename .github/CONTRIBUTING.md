# Contribution Guidelines
awesome-AutoHotkey is a specially curated list for high-quality AutoHotkey Libraries, Library Distributions, Scripts, Tools, Tutorials and Resources.
This resource was made by the AutoHotkey community and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/graphs/contributors).


### How to contribute
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Please contribute items you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.
- To add item or subsection to the list and if you have rights to commit to the list (member of ahkscript organization) just edit list directly (no need for special discussion). If you are not member of ahkscript organization, make an individual pull request for each item.
- Major changes to the list like adding sections or any other major change needs opening discussion in *Issues* of the current repository.
- Chose corresponding section (Libraries, Library Distributions, Scripts, Tools, Tutorial or Resources) and subsection for your item. Functions should be added to corresponding subsection of *Library* section (discussion about function placement: [link](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/issues/35)).
- Subsections and list items should be sorted *alphabetically*. Exceptions are:
  1. In section **Tools**, subsection *Interpreter* comes first.
  3. In section **Resources**, in subsections *Websites*, *Documentation* and *Quick-start guides*, official ones comes first. 
- Each item should follow rules:
 1. First comes the name of the item which in the same time is a link to home page. If there is no home page, the link of official AutoHotkey forum thread (https://autohotkey.com/boards/) of that item. If item has not any of these links then any link you think is most significant for item. 
 2. After should go `-` sign. 
 3. After should go short, clear, concise, and non-promotional description. Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line.
 4. If the item has any other related links, they should go after description. Like this - Forum thread: [link](http://link) .
- Use unique html anchor tags for each subsection. More about it [here](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/issues/12) and [here](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/issues/2#issuecomment-52114056).

The main page [README.md](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/blob/master/README.md) should only contain up-to-date scripts, which work with the latest version of AutoHotkey. Non-up-to-date or discontinued scripts that have historical value should be listed on [Historical.md](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/blob/master/Historical.md)

### Quality standards
To stay on the main list [README.md](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/blob/master/README.md) items should adhere to following quality standards:
- Work with the current AutoHotkey versions.
- Generally useful to the community.
- Functional.
- Stable, or progressing toward stable.

Items that have historical value, but do not work with the current AutoHotkey versions should:
- be moved to [Historical.md](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/blob/master/Historical.md).
- list the required version of AutoHotkey to run the script.

### Reporting issues
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ahkscript/awesome-AutoHotkey/issues/new) if you find anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. Sometimes links may become broken or code become non-functional, please let us know about that kind of issues. Thanks everyone!
